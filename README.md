So client3 and server3 use forks to handle the multiple clients.

Still not sure how to get them to message individuals, like get client 1 to send a message and print out on client 2.

server4 and client4 is more or less like versions 2, but with the structure of versions 3 and uses the multiple ports that we discussed.

I'm stuck though, not sure how to set up the different ports.
